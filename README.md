## init.vim
My config for [Neovim](https://neovim.io). Has support for async completion
(with deoplete), async linting (with ALE), and several QoL features for a
variety of languages.

TODO: replace deoplete completions with LSP powered coc.nvim

## Other files
The other files are pretty self explanatory but they do get touched up
regularly, especially the bashrc.
